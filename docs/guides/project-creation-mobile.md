# Project Creation - Mobile

## Create a New React Native Expo Project

- Open **VS Code** in your desired parent folder of [repo folder](./project-creation-common#clone-the-repository-in-vs-code-using-git-bash)
- Open the [integrated terminal](../configurations#vscode-configurations) in VS Code
- follow the steps in [Create an expo project](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/), choose with typescript, it also has the steps on how to run it, just name it the same as the repo
- Use the integrated Git Bash terminal in VS Code for all commands (e.g., `npm install`)
- run an android emulator in vscode:
  - Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), search for Emulator → View Android emulators → your created emulator should appear
  - Select your configured emulator to launch it directly from VS Code
  - then in terminal when expo is started it will tell you to press `a` to open the app in android emulator
