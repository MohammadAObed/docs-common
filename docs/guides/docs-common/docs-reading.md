# Docs Reading

When Reading/Creating docs

- Read the home page
- Go straight to docs
- Go through get-started, installation, usage
- Dont click any links that appear in content so you dont get distracted, they are for later, unless they reference something previous you skipped, not later
- There is section called: @mohammad_obed/name-of-package section where the code documentation there, dont read it at first, when you get to coding and you're using something you want to know more about, just hover over the function, variable, etc... or you can come here
- Check blog at your free time
